As a user, so I can grow my own oranges, I want to grow an orange tree which produces oranges.

As a user, so my tree can simulate a real orange tree, I want it not to produce oranges for the first few years.

As a user so I can skip to next year, I want to be able to pass time.
    
As a user, so I can see my tree growing, I want my tree to get taller each year.

As a user, so I can see the height, age and amount of oranges, I want to be able to inspect it.
    
As a user, so I can make orange juice, I want to be able to pick an amount of oranges from the tree.

As a user, so I can sell all my oranges, I want to be able to harvest all the oranges from the tree.
    
As a user, to make my tree more realistic, I want the tree to have a finite life.
